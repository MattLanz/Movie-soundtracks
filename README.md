Project for Data Management exam, involving the creation of a NoSQL database, using two or more dataset from different sources.

# Description

This project aims to create a dataset that can be not only a collection of movies and albums, but also, and above all, a basis for studying the associations between the most beloved music and film genres.

The data has been collected from IMDb (https://www.imdb.com), a website that contains all kinds of information about movies and TV shows, where users can provide ratings and reviews, and from Spotify, a music platform that offers on-demand streaming of a large number of songs and albums, where users have the ability to create and upload personalized playlists.

# Libraries

For this project we used mainly Python via Jupyter Notebooks, and the following libraries:

- **Beautifulsoup** for web scraping the IMDb website.
- **Spotipy** to gather data via the Spotify API.

# Results

The result is the creation of a JSON file that contains informations about movies, and the related soundtrack, including informations about songs in the soundtrack.
